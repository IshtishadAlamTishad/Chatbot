       "\"1.2 \\nFINANCIAL POLICY OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES \\n STATEMENT \\nThe presentation and preparation of the Territory’s Budget is provided for in sections 11 and \\n11A of the Financial Management Act 1996 (the Act).   \\nThe purpose of the financial policy objectives and strategies statement is to make transparent \\nthe Government’s financial strategies and to establish a benchmark for evaluating the \\nGovernment’s conduct of financial policy.  The statement is also consistent with section \\n11(1)(a) of the Act. \\nStrategic Priorities and Financial Policy \\nIn this budget, the Government continues its commitment to the principles of responsible \\nfinancial management. \\nThe financial objectives and the key measures below outline the Government’s financial \\npolicy.  Strategic priorities, as they relate to the Territory’s Budget, are summarised as: \\n• maintain a balanced budget over the economic cycle; \\n• maintain low levels of debt; \\n• provide the highest possible standard of government services; \\n• service delivery which focuses on people, the environment and building prosperity;  \\n• maintain a triple A credit rating; and \\n• effective integration of economic and environmental considerations to promote \\nsustainability of service delivery. \\nThe 2005-06 Budget and Forward Estimates have been prepared taking into account the need \\nto provide sustainable social and economic services and infrastructure to the community and \\nthe objective of ecologically sustainable development, as required by the Act.  Future \\nBudgets will over time, as these principles become more firmly integrated with decision \\nmaking processes, demonstrate stronger linkages with these principles.   \\nThe Budget is economically sustainable.  The Budget provides an aggregate surplus over four \\nyears.  Short and long-term financial indicators are sound.  Cash reserves are reducing \\nthrough to 2006-07 but are forecast to grow in 2008-09, and notably, general government \\nborrowings have not increased.   \\nThe Budget is socially responsible.  Considerable resources are directed into key service \\ndelivery areas, such as health, education, child and family support.  In many cases, these \\nresources are dedicated to meeting the increasing demand of a growing and ageing \\npopulation; for example, hospital waiting lists, dental services, and provision of traineeships \\nand apprenticeships to meet skill shortages.  In other cases, resources are targeted at those \\nmost vulnerable and in need; for example, provision for children with disability, family \\nviolence intervention and complex needs, child protection, and pensioner concessions.   \\n2005-06 Budget Paper No. 3 \\n5 \\nFinancial Policy Objectives and Strategies Statement \\nFinally, the Budget supports community welfare and development.  Investments are made \\nwith both short and long-term objectives in mind.  Various projects associated with \\nimplementing the Shaping Our Territory plan and ACT Energy Wise Program are provided \\nfor, while the Asbestos Assessment Task Force helps communicate the risk of asbestos and \\neducates to raise confidence in managing asbestos issues in the community. \\nFinancial Objectives and Key Measures \\nThe following table provides the short-term and long-term financial objectives of the \\nGovernment. \\nTable 1.2.1 \\nFinancial Objectives and Measures \\nShort Term Financial Objectives \\nLong Term Financial Objectives \\nMaintain a Triple A credit rating \\nMaintain low levels of debt \\nMaintain Territory infrastructure \\nMake adequate provision for long-term liabilities \\nStrategic approach to the capital works program Minimise risk to Territory finances and assets \\nProvision of the highest possible standard of \\nGovernment services, and maintain service levels, \\nhaving regard to growth and monetary inflation \\nKey Measures \\nKey Measures \\nMaintain a balanced budget over the economic cycle \\nof the current budget estimates from 2005-06 to \\n2008-09 \\n90% coverage of accrued superannuation liabilities by \\n2039-2040 \\nMaintain the capital infrastructure of the Territory Maintain or reduce GGS debt \\nMaintain net interest cost as a proportion of total \\nown-source revenue for the GGS less than zero \\nAdequate systems and processes in place to recognise \\nand mitigate risk \\nMaintain levels of taxation as a proportion of GSP  \\nMaintain or increase the Territory’s Net Assets  \\nMaintain a Balanced Budget over the economic cycle \\nThe balanced budget financial objective is measured by the operating result of the General \\nGovernment Sector (GGS).  A four-year planning horizon recognises that it is not always \\nnecessary to deliver surpluses every year without any regard to the broader context of the \\neconomy and the service and infrastructure requirements of the community.  What is \\nimportant is that a surplus is delivered over the economic cycle. \\n2005-06 Budget Paper No. 3 \\n6 \\nFinancial Policy Objectives and Strategies Statement \\nThe Government’s forecast operating result is presented in the following table.   \\nTable 1.2.2 \\nGeneral Government Sector \\n2005-06 Budget and Forward Estimates \\n2002-03 2003-04 2004-05 2005-06 2006-07 2007-08 2008-09\\n Actual Actual Est.

The Government’s target for this measure is to ensure \\nthat the level of net interest cost remains negative, indicating the Territory can comfortably \\nmeet interest expenses. \\nTable 1.2.4 \\nGeneral Government Sector \\nNet Interest Expense as a percentage of Own-Source Revenue \\n2004-05 2005-06 2006-07 2007-08 2008-09\\n Est.

The Government has a commitment to fund 90% of accrued \\nsuperannuation liabilities by 30 June 2040.  In light of the significantly lower projected \\nliabilities following the introduction of the PSS accumulation scheme, this target date will be \\nreviewed during 2005-06 with a view to determining whether an earlier date should be \\nadopted.  The outcome of this process will be reported in the 2006-07 Budget. \\nTable 1.2.7 \\nPercentage funding of Superannuation Liabilities \\nAssets Liabilities % Funded\\n 30 June $'000 $'000\\n 2005            1  447  094           2  480  943 58%\\n 2006            1  626  868           2  707  023 60%\\n 2007            1  829  509            2  927  773 62%\\n 2008            2  042  190           3  146  890 65%\\n 2009 2  266  537 3  365  107 67%\\n \\n \\nPrinciples of Responsible Financial Management \\nThe key financial measures established by the Government satisfy various principles of \\nresponsible financial management specified within the Financial Management Act 1996, \\nthese are: \\n(a) ensuring that the total liabilities of the Territory are at prudent levels to provide a buffer \\nagainst factors that may impact adversely on the level of total Territory liabilities in the \\nfuture, and ensuring that, until prudent levels have been achieved, the total operating \\nexpenses of the Territory in each financial year are less than its operating income levels \\nin the same financial year; \\n(b) when prudent levels of total Territory liabilities have been achieved, maintaining the \\nlevels by ensuring that, on average, over a reasonable period of time, the total operating \\nexpenses of the Territory do not exceed its operating income levels;  \\n2005-06 Budget Paper No. 3 9 Financial Policy Objectives and Strategies Statement \\n(c) \\nachieving and maintaining levels of Territory net worth to provide a buffer against \\nfactors that may impact adversely on levels of Territory net worth in the future;  \\n(d) \\n(e) \\n(f) \\nmanaging prudently the fiscal risks of the Territory; \\npursuing spending and taxing policies that are consistent with a reasonable degree of \\nstability and predictability in the level of the tax burden; and \\ngiving full, accurate and timely disclosure of financial information about the activities \\nof the government and its agencies. \\nThe key financial objectives outlined earlier in this chapter support the principles of \\nresponsible fiscal management. \\nThe objectives of a balanced budget over the economic cycle, the maintenance of low levels \\nof debt and adequate provision for long-term liabilities strongly support prudent financial \\nmanagement and the principles of inter-generational equity.   \\nExpenses must be balanced against revenues, borrowings must be within manageable limits \\nand repayments affordable from ongoing revenues.   \\nThe Territory’s prudent investment policies are designed to protect the value of the \\nTerritory’s more liquid assets thus maintaining this asset base for the settlement of future \\nliabilities.   \\nA strategic approach to capital works programs reflects a longer term view of key \\ninfrastructure decisions such as the timely delivery of new infrastructure and the timely \\nreplacement of infrastructure balanced against the changing demographics and changing \\nservice delivery needs. \\nThe 2005-06 Budget contains a significant level of funding for new construction and \\nupgrades of existing infrastructure. \\nA number of strategic new infrastructure items have been approved for construction or design \\nin the 2005-06 Budget to enhance services for the people of the ACT.  These include a major \\nnew recreational area at Stromlo Forest Park, a new Primary and Pre-School in East \\nGungahlin and a replacement for the Quamby Youth Detention Centre.  Additional funding \\nfor continuing projects such as the Gungahlin Drive Extension and the Alexander \\nMaconachie Centre (Correctional Facility) has also been included. \\nA base level of funding has also been provided for capital upgrades; that is, works which \\nincrease service delivery capacity or extend the useful lives of existing assets.  A further \\nprovision has been made to finance capital upgrades through a five-year rolling program. \\n2005-06 Budget Paper No. 3 \\n10 \\nFinancial Policy Objectives and Strategies Statement \""
